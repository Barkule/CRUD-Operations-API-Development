# CRUD Operations API Development

This repository contains a backend API project implementing basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations**. The API is designed to demonstrate best practices in API development, including modular code structure, error handling, and RESTful conventions.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for standard CRUD operations
- Structured project organization
- Example data models (customize as needed)
- Error handling and validation
- Easy-to-run development environment

## Technologies Used

- Language: **[Add your language, e.g., Node.js, Python, Java, etc.]**
- Framework: **[Express, Django, Spring Boot, etc.]**
- Database: **[MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.]**
- Other: [List any additional tools/libraries]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) / [Python](https://python.org/) / [Java](https://java.com/) (specify your version)
- [Database] installed and running (optional: Docker)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Barkule/CRUD-Operations-API-Development.git
   cd CRUD-Operations-API-Development
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   # For Node.js
   npm install

   # For Python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values as needed.

4. **Run database migrations (if applicable):**
   ```sh
   # Example for Node.js with Sequelize
   npx sequelize db:migrate

   # Example for Django
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

### Running the Application

```sh
# For Node.js
npm start

# For Python (Flask/Django)
python app.py

# For Java (Spring Boot)
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port configured in your `.env`).

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description         |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| GET    | `/items`         | Get all items      |
| GET    | `/items/:id`     | Get item by ID     |
| POST   | `/items`         | Create new item    |
| PUT    | `/items/:id`     | Update item by ID  |
| DELETE | `/items/:id`     | Delete item by ID  |

*Replace `items` and endpoints as per your actual model/routes.*
